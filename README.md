Welcome to the Cafe, where you can input, delete and update orders. After completing your order, simply click on it to update its completion status in the system.

# <strong>How It's Made:</strong>
<strong>Tech used</strong>: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, Express

I use MongoDb to save the cafe orders, where they are later retrieved from the database and posted onto ejs in order to be displayed. This application uses CRUD to transmit the data passed around between the database and the different pages that make up this full-stack application. 


# <strong>Lesson Learned:</strong>
I am practicing different ways of using put requests to update the data displayed to the user and further familiarizing myself with Express syntax. Express is used as a framework in order to simplify node.
